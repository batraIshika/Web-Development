  <!-- My Personal Information-->
<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p class="text">I,Ishika Batra, am an International Student and I live in Punjab,India.
  My Hometown is Ludhiana.It is called the Manchestor of Punjab and is very famous for Hosiery and Cycle Part Manufacturing.
  I have been living here since 19 years and I will miss it badly once I travel to Australia to pursue my Higher Studies .</p>
<p class="text">I wasn't intersted in Computer Science till Grade 9.In grade 9 and 10 we were taught Java ,Microsoft Office,and Internet <br>
  as a part of our curriculum and this was the time when I made up my mind to pursue Computer Science in my Undergraduation.
  I have opted Cyber Security as my major and I am too curious to study it .Even while doing my core units I enjoy studying
  and the happiness which I get after completing a task successfully is unique.</p>
  <p class="text">Well,if I talk about book reading, I am least interested in it and I prefer audio-visual appproach to learn new things. </p>
  <p class="text">"Sad ?,Just plug in your earphones and listen to your favourite playlist!" This is what I follow.My love for music cannot fade away..<br>
  Listening to music and even singing pleases me and all my sorrows fly away.</p>
  <p class="text">The only genre of films that I like is Sci-fi. As I am not a movie freak, I only watch movies related to science or technology as<br> they motivate me in  one or another way and even makes me more curious to deeply  learn  my subject </p>
